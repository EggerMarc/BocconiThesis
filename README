This is the work I've done for my Bachelor's Thesis at Bocconi University.
The following scripts include the data cleaner, model creation, trade algorithm, as well as sporadic visualization.
Due to the size of the models they cannot be uploaded (over 100mb).
Organization is not my strength :/

Enjoy!
